LED Pin           |            Arduino Uno Pin

5V      ------------->VCC 

GND      ---------->GND

DIN     ---------> Digital Pin 11

CS     ----------->Digital Pin 10

CLK     ---------->Digital Pin 13

Installing the Required Library

To use the 8x8 LED matrix module, you need to install the LedControl library.

Steps:

Open the Arduino IDE.

Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.

In the Library Manager, search for "LedControl".

Select the library by Eberhard Fahle and click Install.


#Functionalities

The provided code enables the following features:

1. Display Emotions (Emoji)

Predefined patterns simulate various emotions .

Each pattern is stored as an array of bytes.

2. Display Numbers (0-9)

A looped display of digits from 0 to 9.

Useful for countdowns, clocks, or numeric displays.

3. Display Alphabets (A-Z)

Animates letters of the English alphabet sequentially.

Includes functionality for custom name displays.

4. Directional Animations

Patterns (e.g., arrows) that move in specific directions (left-to-right, right-to-left).

Configurable speed for animations.

5. Heart Animation

Displays a heart shape growing (small to big) or beating.

6. Display Your Name

Use a custom name generator to create an array for your name.
